This section records information for easy reference.

\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.
~\newline

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}

    \midrule 
    \si{\metre} & length & metre\\
    \si{\kilogram} & mass	& kilogram\\
    \si{\second} & time & second\\
    \si{\newton} & force & N (N = \si{\kilogram \metre\per\square\second} )\\

\plt{Only include the units that your SRS actually uses.}

\plt{Derived units, like newtons, pascal, etc, should show their derivation
    (the units they are derived from) if their constituent units are in the
    table of units (that is, if the units they are derived from are used in the
    document).  For instance, the derivation of pascals as
    $\si{\pascal}=\si{\newton\per\square\meter}$ is shown if newtons and m are
    both in the table.  The derivations of newtons would not be shown if kg and
    s are not both in the table.}

\plt{The symbol for units named after people use capital letters, but the name
  of the unit itself uses lower case.  For instance, pascals use the symbol Pa,
  watts use the symbol W, teslas use the symbol T, newtons use the symbol N,
  etc.  The one exception to this is degree Celsius.  Details on writing metric
  units can be found on the 
  \href{https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units}
  {NIST} web-page.}

\subsection{Table of Symbols}

The table that follows summarizes the symbols used in this document along with
their units.  The choice of symbols was made to be consistent with the heat
transfer literature and with existing documentation for solar water heating
systems.  The symbols are listed in alphabetical order.

\subsection{Mathematical Notation}

Vectors are represented with an arrow on top. 
For example, $\vec{x}$ denotes a vector, while $m$ 
represents a scalar. By default, a vector $\vec{x}$ 
belongs to $\mathbb{R}^2$, and if it belongs to higher dimensions, 
it is explicitly specified in the text. The symbol $\cdot$ 
signifies the dot product between two vectors.


\plt{This section is optional, but should be included for projects that make use
  of notation to convey mathematical information.  For instance, if typographic
  conventions (like bold face font) are used to distinguish matrices, this
  should be stated here.  If symbols are used to show mathematical operations,
  these should be summarized here.  In some cases the easiest way to summarize
  the notation is to point to a text or other source that explains the
  notation.}

\plt{This section was added to the template because some students use very
  domain specific notation.  This notation will not be readily understandable to
  people outside of your domain.  It should be explained.}

\section{Introduction}

The inverted pendulum problem is a classic challenge in control theory,
involving the stabilization of an upright pendulum atop a moving pivot.
Its inherent instability makes it a compelling theoretical exercise,
demanding precise control to prevent the pendulum from falling.
This problem acts as a benchmark for testing and refining control algorithms,
influencing advancements in areas like autonomous vehicles, robotics,
and stability control for devices such as self-balancing scooters.
The insights gained from solving this problem have practical applications,
shaping developments in real-world systems that demand stability
and dynamic control. The \progname{} (IPCS) software aims to simulate the physical
system of an inverted pendulum and design a control system to keep the pendulum
upright. This document outlines the requirements for the \progname{} software,
providing a clear and unambiguous description of the software's functionalities,
features, and constraints.

\plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts
  general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with
a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap''
paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to
expect in the Introduction section.}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

\plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
  on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
  Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
  in the context of the project itself, not in the context of this course.
  Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade, you should not
  mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real project.  The purpose
  section will be similar between projects.  The purpose of the document is the
  purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning for the design stage,
  etc.}

The primary purpose of this document is to provide a clear and unambiguous
description of the software's functionalities, features, and constraints,
serving as a bridge between the client's expectations and 
the development team's understanding. By meticulously documenting 
the project's requirements, the SRS enables effective communication 
between stakeholders, including clients, developers, testers, 
and project managers. It acts as a blueprint that helps 
in minimizing misunderstandings, mitigating risks, and ensuring 
that the final software product aligns with the client's needs 
and specifications. Additionally, it serves as a valuable 
reference point for developers, guiding them in the creation 
of a robust and reliable software solution while facilitating 
effective project management and quality assurance processes.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

In this project, the scope is delimited to two dimensions. 
The pendulum is affixed to the cart in a manner enabling 
free rotation about the pivot, while the cart possesses 
horizontal mobility. The primary focus of this project is 
on simulating system behavior and designing a control system 
for said simulation, with a specific emphasis on efficient execution. 
For further elucidation, readers are directed to the assumptions section.

\plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
  the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
  for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
  the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
  the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
  actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
  it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
  properties, etc.}  

\plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
  at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
  on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
  describes, all of the assumptions.}

\plt{The scope section is relevant for later determining typical values of inputs. The scope should make it clear what inputs are reasonable to expect. This is a distinction between scope and context (context is a later section).  Scope affects the inputs while context affects how the software will be used.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

To effectively comprehend this material, readers or reviewers 
should be familiar with the principles of physics, 
specifically in the context of applying Newton's laws of motion. 
Additionally, a strong understanding of calculus, 
particularly in differentiation and integration, is essential. 
Proficiency in these subjects is typically attained through 
undergraduate engineering courses or at a high school level.

\plt{This section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
  SRS.  It does NOT have the same purpose as the ``User Characteristics''
  section (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}).  The intended readers are the
  people that will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that
  will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the
  requirements.  The user, on the other hand, is the person that uses the
  software that is built.  They may never read this SRS document.  Of course,
  the same person could be a ``user'' and an ``intended reader.''}

\plt{The intended reader characteristics should be written as unambiguously and
  as specifically as possible.  Rather than say, the user should have an
  understanding of physics, say what kind of physics and at what level.  For
  instance, is high school physics adequate, or should the reader have had a
  graduate course on advanced quantum mechanics?}

\subsection{Organization of Document}

The rest of this document is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:general_desc} discusses the
general context and description of the system. Section \ref{sec:specific_user_desc} details the
specific system description, goals, and definitions. Section \ref{sec:reqs} covers system
requirements. Section \ref{sec:likely_changes} outlines likely changes for the system. Section
\ref{sec:unlikely_changes} discusses unlikely changes. Section \ref{sec:trace} covers the
traceability of the requirements.

\plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
  reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
  select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
  be similar between project.}

\section{General System Description} \label{sec:general_desc}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  \plt{This text can likely be
  borrowed verbatim.}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

The system consists of three primary components:
the \textit{System Dynamics} module, responsible for simulating
the physical state of the pendulum; the \textit{Control System},  
which receives the pendulum's state information and applies
external forces to the cart to maintain the pendulum's upright 
position; and the \textit{Visualizer} or GUI (Graphical User Interface), 
which presents the system's state information to the user. 
The interaction between these components and the user 
is outlined in \hyperref[Fig_SystemContext]{Figure \ref*{Fig_SystemContext}}.
Users provide initial conditions for the system, 
such as the mass of the cart and pendulum, 
as well as the angular position of the pendulum. In the output, 
users can view the state of the system in different time steps in real-time.

% \caption{System Context}
% \label{Fig_SystemContext} 
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilities should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide required inputs, including cart and pole specifications, 
      as well as initial conditions of the system.
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
% \item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
%   floating point number
\item Calculate the physical state of the system for different time steps.
\item Display and visualize the calculated physical state to the user.
\item Implement control strategies to stabilize the pendulum and 
      maintain its upright position.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\plt{Identify in what context the software will typically be used.  Is it for
exploration? education? engineering work? scientific work?. Identify whether it
will be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications.} \plt{This
additional context information is needed to determine how much effort should be
devoted to the rationale section.  If the application is safety-critical, the
bar is higher.  This is currently less structured, but analogous to, the idea to
the Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) that McSCert uses in their
automotive hazard analyses.}

\wss{The }
\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The intended users of the system do not require extensive technical expertise;
rather, basic computer literacy is sufficient for running the program 
and observing the simulation. However, for users wishing to delve deeper 
into result analysis, a solid foundation in undergraduate-level mathematics 
and physics is necessary. Proficiency in mathematical concepts such as calculus 
as well as a fundamental understanding of physics principles, 
will enable users to effectively interpret and analyze the simulation outcomes.

\plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
  Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
  requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
  different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
  Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
  user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
  end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
  Calculus and Physics.''}

\subsection{System Constraints}

There are no system constraints for this project.
\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
  limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
  included if they are truly required.}

\section{Specific System Description} \label{sec:specific_user_desc}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.  \plt{Add any project specific details that are relevant
  for the section overview.}

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{} is intended to solve 
the classic challenge in control theory known as
the inverted pendulum problem. This problem involves
the stabilization of an upright pendulum atop a moving pivot,
characterized by its inherent instability that demands
precise control to prevent the pendulum from falling. 
Basically, we are going to simulate the physical system of 
an inverted pendulum and build a controller to keep the pendulum upright. 
It serves as a benchmark for testing and refining control algorithms,
influencing advancements in areas like autonomous vehicles, robotics,
and stability control for devices such as self-balancing scooters.
The insights gained from solving this problem have practical applications,
shaping developments in real-world systems that
demand stability and dynamic control.
% \plt{What problem does your program solve?
% The description here should be in the problem space, not the solution space.}

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

\plt{This section is expressed in words, not with equations.  It provide the
  meaning of the different words and phrases used in the domain of the problem.
The terminology is used to introduce concepts from the world outside of the
mathematical model  The terminology provides a real world connection to give the
mathematical model meaning.}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item Inverted Pendulum: An inverted pendulum refers to a 
pendulum where its center of mass is positioned above 
its pivot point. Due to its unstable nature, 
it tends to topple over without external assistance.

\item Friction: Friction denotes the resistance force 
encountered when one solid object slides or rolls over another.

\item Control System: A control system is a system that
manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior 
of other devices or systems.

\item State: The state of a system refers to a set of
quantities that determine the behavior of the system over time.

\item Stabilization: Stabilization refers to the process of
maintaining the pendulum within a small deviation from the upright position.

\item Force Equilibrium: A body achieves force 
equilibrium when the total sum of all forces acting upon it equals zero.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the
  physical system that is to be modelled. Effective problem solving requires a
  logical and organized approach. The statements on the physical system to be
  studied should cover enough information to solve the problem. The physical
  description involves element identification, where elements are defined as
  independent and separable items of the physical system. Some example elements
  include acceleration due to gravity, the mass of an object, and the size and
  shape of an object. Each element should be identified and labelled, with their
  interesting properties specified clearly. The physical description can also
  include interactions of the elements, such as the following: i) the
  interactions between the elements and their physical environment; ii) the
  interactions between elements; and, iii) the initial or boundary conditions.}

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in \hyperref[diagram]{Figure \ref*{diagram}},
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item[PS1:] Pendulum

\begin{itemize}
  \item[PS1a:] rod (with lengh of $l$)
  \item[PS1b:] ball (with mass of $m$)
\end{itemize}

\item[PS2:] Cart (with mass of $M$)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

\plt{The goal statements refine the ``Problem Description''
  (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  A goal is a functional objective the system under
  consideration should achieve. Goals provide criteria for sufficient
  completeness of a requirements specification and for requirements
  pertinence. Goals will be refined in Section “Instanced Models”
  (Section~\ref{sec_instance}). Large and complex goals should be decomposed
  into smaller sub-goals.  The goals are written abstractly, with a minimal
  amount of technical language.  They should be understandable by non-domain
  experts.}

\noindent Given the cart and the pendulum specifications 
(mass of cart, mass of ball, length of rod) and the initial 
conditions, the goal statements are:

% \begin{itemize}

% \item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{One
%     sentence description of the goal.  There may be more than one.  Each Goal
%     should have a meaningful label.}
% \end{itemize}

Simulate the state of the system, position of the cart and the angle of the pendulum arm, over time.

Implement Control Algorithm that effectively stabilizes
the inverted pendulum system and maintain the pendulum

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

\plt{This section specifies the information in the solution domain of the system
  to be developed. This section is intended to express what is required in
  such a way that analysts and stakeholders get a clear picture, and the
  latter will accept it. The purpose of this section is to reduce the problem
  into one expressed in mathematical terms. Mathematical expertise is used to
  extract the essentials from the underlying physical description of the
  problem, and to collect and substantiate all physical data pertinent to the
  problem.}

\plt{This section presents the solution characteristics by successively refining
  models.  It starts with the abstract/general Theoretical Models (TMs) and
  refines them to the concrete/specific Instance Models (IMs).  If necessary
  there are intermediate refinements to General Definitions (GDs).  All of these
  refinements can potentially use Assumptions (A) and Data Definitions (DD).
  TMs are refined to create new models, that are called GMs or IMs. DDs are not
  refined; they are just used. GDs and IMs are derived, or refined, from other
  models. DDs are not derived; they are just given. TMs are also just given, but
  they are refined, not used.  If a potential DD includes a derivation, then
  that means it is refining other models, which would make it a GD or an IM.}

\plt{The above makes a distinction between ``refined'' and ``used.'' A model is
  refined to another model if it is changed by the refinement. When we change a
  general 3D equation to a 2D equation, we are making a refinement, by applying
  the assumption that the third dimension does not matter. If we use a
  definition, like the definition of density, we aren't refining, or changing
  that definition, we are just using it.}

\plt{The same information can be a TM in one problem and a DD in another.  It is
  about how the information is used.  In one problem the definition of
  acceleration can be a TM, in another it would be a DD.}

\plt{There is repetition between the information given in the different chunks
  (TM, GDs etc) with other information in the document.  For instance, the
  meaning of the symbols, the units etc are repeated.  This is so that the
  chunks can stand on their own when being read by a reviewer/user.  It also
  facilitates reuse of the models in a different context.}

\noindent \plt{The relationships between the parts of the document are show in
  the following figure.  In this diagram ``may ref'' has the same role as
  ``uses'' above.  The figure adds ``Likely Changes,'' which are able to
  reference (use) Assumptions.}

\begin{figure}[H]

The instance models that govern \progname{} are presented in
Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the meaning of the
instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

\plt{The assumptions are a refinement of the scope.  The scope is general, where
  the assumptions are specific.  All assumptions should be listed, even those
  that domain experts know so well that they are rarely (if ever) written down.}
\plt{The document should not take for granted that the reader knows which
  assumptions have been made. In the case of unusual assumptions, it is
  recommended that the documentation either include, or point to, an explanation
  and justification for the assumption.}
\plt{If it helps with the organization and understandability, the assumptions can be presented as sub sections.  The following sub-sections are options: background theory assumptions, helper theory assumptions, generic theory assumptions, problem specific assumptions, and rationale assumptions}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system.
The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model [TM],
general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or likely
change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

%   \plt{Short description of each assumption.  Each assumption
%     should have a meaningful label.  Use cross-references to identify the

%     explicit (or implicit) ``and'' in the text of an assumption.}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

\plt{Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms
  for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''
  (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}). Examples of theoretical models are
  physical laws, constitutive equations, relevant conversion factors, etc.}

\plt{Optionally the theory section could be divided into subsections to provide more structure and improve understandability and reusability.  Potential subsections include the following: Context theories, background theories, helper theories, generic theories, problem specific theories, final theories and rationale theories.}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based
on.  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models
  as appropriate.}

\plt{``Ref.\ By'' is used repeatedly with the different types of information.
  This stands for Referenced By.  It means that the models, definitions and
  assumptions listed reference the current model, definition or assumption.
  This information is given for traceability.  Ref. By provides a pointer in the
  opposite direction to what we commonly do.  You still need to have a reference
  in the other direction pointing to the current model, definition or
  assumption.  As an example, if TM1 is referenced by GD2, that means that GD2 will
  explicitly include a reference to TM1.}

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

\plt{General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of
  other GDs.  The GDs are less abstract than the TMs.  Generally the reduction
  in abstraction is possible through invoking (using/referencing) Assumptions.
  For instance, the TM could be Newton's Law of Cooling stated abstracting.  The
  GD could take the general law and apply it to get a 1D equation.}

This section collects the laws and equations that will be used in building the
instance models.
The global coordinate system referenced in the subsequent equations is 
positioned within the plane. Consequently, the cart's position, which 
consistently remains grounded relative to the general coordinate system, 
is expressed as $\vec{r}_c = x_c(t) \hat{i}$.

\subsubsection*{Derivation of the cart motion equation}

In reference to the relative coordinate system depicted in Figure \ref{Fig_InvertedPendulumSchematic}, 
the position of the pendulum can be defined as 
$\vec{r}_p = (-l\sin\theta(t)) \hat{i} + (l\cos\theta(t)) \hat{j}$. 
The values $l\sin\theta(t)$ and $l\cos\theta(t)$ are straightforwardly 
derived from the definitions of trigonometric functions within a 
right triangle. The negative sign preceding $l\sin\theta(t)$ accounts 
for the pendulum's angle increasing counter-clockwise 
from the vertical axis, with its zero position at the top.

The global coordinate system is situated somewhere within the plane. 
Consequently, the cart's position, which consistently remains 
grounded relative to the general coordinate system, is expressed 
as $\vec{r}_c = x_c(t) \hat{i}$. By combining the cart's position with 
that of the pendulum, we can ascertain the pendulum's position 
relative to the global coordinate system. Thus, 
$\vec{r}_p = \vec{r}_c + \vec{r}_p = (x_c(t)-l\sin\theta(t)) \hat{i} + (l\cos\theta(t)) \hat{j}$.

\subsubsection*{Derivation of the cart motion equation}

The acceleration of the pendulum can be obtained by computing the 
second derivative of its position vector. Denoted as 
$\vec{r}_P = (x_c(t)-l\sin\theta(t))\hat{i} + (l\cos\theta(t)) \hat{j}$, 
this represents the pendulum's position vector. Its first derivative 
is given by $ \frac{d}{dt} \vec{r}_P = (\dot{x_c}(t)-l\dot{\theta}(t)\cos\theta(t))\hat{i} 
+ (-l\dot{\theta}(t)\sin\theta(t)) \hat{j}$. Further differentiation leads 
to the second derivative of the position vector, expressed as $\frac{d^2}{dt^2}
\vec{r}_P = (\ddot{x_c}(t)+l\dot{\theta}^2(t)\sin\theta(t)-l\ddot{\theta}(t)\cos\theta(t))\hat{i} 
+ (-l\dot{\theta}^2(t)\cos\theta(t) - l\ddot{\theta}(t)\sin\theta(t)) \hat{j}$.

\subsubsection*{Derivation of the cart motion equation}

If we write the second law of Newton (\tref{TM:NSL}) for the cart in the x-axis, 
we obtain $F - R_x = (M+m)\ddot{x}$, where $R_x$ represents the reaction 
forces at the joint. It is known that 
$R_x = m (\ddot{x} + l\dot{\theta}^2\sin\theta-l \ddot{\theta}\cos\theta)$ 
by \tref{TM:NSL} and \dref{G_pendulum_acceleration}. 
By substituting $R_x$ into the first equation, 
we derive the equation of motion for the cart (first one).

Based on the second law of Newton (\tref{TM:NSL}), we can write 
the equation of motion for the pendulum as 
$\Sigma \vec{F} = m \vec{a_P}$. We define a unit vector 
$\vec{x_b} = \cos\theta \hat{i} + \sin\theta \hat{j}$, 
which is perpendicular to the pendulum at all times. 
Therefore, $\vec{x_b}^T \cdot \Sigma \vec{F} = -mg\sin\theta$, 
indicating that $-mg\sin\theta$ is the only force acting 
on the pendulum in the perpendicular direction. 
Additionally, we can calculate the $\vec{a_P}$ 
(\dref{G_pendulum_acceleration}) of the pendulum 
in the perpendicular direction as 
$\vec{x_b}^T \cdot m \vec{a_P} = m(\ddot{x}\cos\theta - l\ddot{\theta})$. 
By equating these two equations, we obtain the equation 
of motion for the pendulum (second one).

%   where the derivation cannot be described under the Description field, it will

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\plt{This section is not for test cases or techniques for verification and

\section{Requirements} \label{sec:reqs}

\plt{The requirements refine the goal statement.  They will make heavy use of
  references to the instance models.}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:]
    Check validity of the input data, like the masses of the cart and pendulum,
    and the initial positions of both the cart and pendulum,
    based on the specifications provided in \hyperref[TblInputVar]{Table \ref*{TblInputVar}}.
    % \plt{Requirements
    % for the inputs that are supplied by the user.  This information has to be
    % explicit.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_cart_position}:]
    The system shall calculate the position of
    the cart over the simulation time. (\iref{I_cart_motion})
    % \plt{It isn't
    % always required, but often echoing the inputs as part of the output is a
    % good idea.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_pendulum_position}:]
    The system shall calculate the angular position
    of the pendulum over the simulation time. (\iref{I_cart_motion})
    % \plt{Calculation
    % related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_control_system}:]
    The system shall implement control strategies to stabilize 
    the pendulum and ensure it remains upright after 
    a reasonable number of time-steps.
    % \plt{Verification related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:]
    The system shall provide real-time visualization of the pendulum's state to the user.
    % \plt{Output related
    % requirements.}

\end{itemize}

\plt{Every IM should map to at least one requirement, but not every requirement
  has to map to a corresponding IM.}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
  criterion to make them verifiable.}
\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
  and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
  instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
  for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
  describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
  possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
  SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
  Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
  correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
  solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:] 
\textbf{Accuracy} The relative error in the location of the cart and pendulum 
for \progname{} will be compared with that of the benchmark program. 
Refer to the Verification and Validation Plan for details.
  %  \plt{Characterize the accuracy by giving the context/use for
  %   the software.  Maybe something like, ``The accuracy of the computed
  %   solutions should meet the level needed for $<$engineering or scientific
  %   application$>$.  The level of accuracy achieved by \progname{} shall be
  %   described following the procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and
  %   Validation Plan.''  A link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability}
  There results of the simulation shall be clearly visualized to the user.
  % \plt{Characterize the usability by giving the context/use for the software.
  %   You should likely reference the user characteristics section.  The level of
  %   usability achieved by the software shall be described following the
  %   procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and Validation Plan.  A
  %   link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability}
  Main modules shall be independent and easily replaceable with clear API.
  % \plt{The effort required to make any of the likely
  %   changes listed for \progname{} should be less than FRACTION of the original
  %   development time.  FRACTION is then a symbolic constant that can be defined
  %   at the end of the report.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability}
  \progname{} should be able to run on both Linux and MacOS operating systems.
  % \plt{This NFR is easier to write than the others.  The
  %   systems that \progname{} should run on should be listed here.  When possible
  %   the specific versions of the potential operating environments should be
  %   given.  To make the NFR verifiable a statement could be made that the tests
  %   from a given section of the VnV plan can be successfully run on all of the
  %   possible operating environments.}

% \item Other NFRs that might be discussed include verifiability,
%   understandability and reusability.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}

The assumptions made for the inverted pendulum problem are geared 
towards simplifying the system's dynamics to facilitate analysis 
and solution development. Among these, pivotal assumptions entail 
treating the pole as possessing a single degree of rotational 
freedom (\aref{A_1dRotaion}) and the cart as having one degree 
of freedom for its forward and backward motion (\aref{A_1dxAxis}).
These simplifications significantly facilitate the process of 
formulating equations governing the motion of both the cart 
and the pendulum (\iref{I_cart_motion}).
% The requirements outlined in this section serve to guide 
% the development of the pendulum control system, ensuring 
% its functionality and usability. Functional requirements 
% address key aspects like input processing, position calculation, 
% control strategy implementation, and real-time visualization, 
% aiming for accuracy and user-friendliness.

\plt{Provide a rationale for the decisions made in the documentation.  Rationale
should be provided for scope decisions, modelling decisions, assumptions and
typical values.}

\section{Likely Changes} \label{sec:likely_changes}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_friction}:]
    \progname{} make use of a frictionless cart and the ground (\aref{A_noFriction}).
    % \plt{Give
    % the likely changes, with a reference to the related assumption (aref), as appropriate.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes} \label{sec:unlikely_changes}

None.

% \noindent \begin{itemize}

% \item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{Give
%     the unlikely changes.  The design can assume that the changes listed will
%     not occur.}

% \end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs} \label{sec:trace}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}
